**DAD_Project**, Developer-AI-Diade is a clean, customizable modular development tool creating "lego_blocks" for our python projects. The DAD_blocks are reusable in all projects and are small enough to create and improve in short AI-sessions. By referring to the basic concepts in GitHub .gits AI's are able to become informed about the basic DAD-Project concepts: python only, small reusable blocks that combine exclusively yet dynamically fit in the main.py files. The concept is developed in extenso for Django templates.
